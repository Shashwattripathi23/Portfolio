Yo, you wanna see something cool?
No? Well I'ma do it anyway

[Chorus]
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin', run—
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin'
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin', run—
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and—

[Verse 1: Joey Valence]
Step into the scene
No, nobody can do it like me
Zoo Pals plate with the Kid Cuisine
I was the blacktop king
360s in my green machine
I was a kid and I was breaking down doors
Listening to Tribe, now we on a world tour
We gave 'em Hell and now we gonna give 'em more
JVB mighty morphin' like Megazord

[Verse 2: Brae]
Yo, power like Ranger, range like Rover
Strong bulldozer
Autobots roll out, hit the scene
Fresh wax on the paint, it's clean
Hooligang light up the tires
Thе JZs poppin' and spittin' out fire
Never rеtire, stare and admire
My drip don't expire (Oh my God, that is fire!)

[Chorus]
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin', run—
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin', run—
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin', run—
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and—

[Post-Chorus]
Runnin' and runnin' and run— Runnin' and runnin' and run— run—
Runnin'— Runnin'— Runnin'—

[Verse 3: Joey Valence]
'Cause I'm shell shocked like a Koopa Troopa
Everybody knows that I'm super, super, Super Saiyan
I was born indestructible
Now I'm always goin' ham like a Lunchable

[Verse 4: Brae]
I'ma stay running, this view is stunning
My blood is rushing, you got me blushing
I must keep trucking, won't catch me bugging
I'm the Omega, end of discussion

[Verse 5: Joey Valence]
Hooligang who? Cozy Coupe, that's the ticket
Shoes, Reeboks in twos when I choose to kick it
Fenced like a picket
Eyes stay glued and the style stay wicked
[Verse 6: Brae & Joey Valence]
Swing through ya hood, Spider-Man
Initial D, drift Japan
Starving wolf, Duran Duran
Green light, red light (Don't stop when I'm runnin' like)

[Chorus]
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin', run—
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin', run—
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin', run—
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and— (Let me hear you say)

[Post-Chorus]
Runnin' and runnin' and run— Runnin' and runnin' and run— run—
Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and— (Let me hear you say)
Runnin' and runnin' and run— Runnin' and runnin' and run— run—
